	* Release 1.05.
	
	* This release adds explicit frames support to the start_html() and 
	end_html() methods, so that they can be used in the construction of an 
	HTML 4 frameset document.  It is assumed in that case that any HTML going 
	between the output of these two methods would be for browsers that don't 
	understand frames, that is, the "noframes" section.  Each method has an 
	additional argument now for frame support.  The new 4th argument to 
	start_html() is usually a hash of attributes for the <FRAMESET> tag, and 
	the various <FRAME> tags would be provided via the hash key 'text'.  The 
	new 1st argument to end_html() causes it to make the closing noframes tag.

	* No other changes except for 5 additional tests in test.pl and minor POD 
	updates.  This release is backwards compatible with previous ones.

	* Release 1.04.
	
	* HTML::EasyTags now does not require any other modules and will work on its 
	own.  The small portion of Class::ParamParser that this class did use has 
	been copied over into a private method, which adds less than 1K.  The change 
	should make HTML::EasyTags easier to use since fundamentally it is a 
	base-level module and now it acts like it.
	
	* Minor changes were made to the module's POD and other documentation files.
	
	* Modified test.pl so that it automatically trims long outputs at 50 
	characters, ensuring that each "ok NN" line does not wrap to multiple lines.
	This behaviour can be toggled with the $verbose variable.

	* Release 1.0301.
	
	* This release fixes a couple of documentation bugs.  There were no 
	changes made to the code itself as that was fine.
	
	* The SYNOPSIS section used to show one calling start_html() using named 
	parameters, a feature which was dropped after v1.01.  The method actually 
	takes positional parameters only, and SYNOPSIS has been updated to show 
	proper calling style.
	
	* Also fixed a bug in the ReadMe file where the file heading said 
	"class method parameter parser" instead of "easy html tag maker".
	The wrong heading referred to a different distribution.

	* Release 1.03.
	
	* This release is the first one that includes the CPAN standard files 
	"Makefile.PL", "test.pl", and "MANIFEST", which were all created following 
	the previous release.  The content of "Manifest" was previously inside the 
	"ReadMe" file.  Improved the install instructions in my ReadMe file.
	
	* Added programmer documentation to the various blocks of code, so it is 
	easier to see how they work; useful because a lot is done with little code.
	
	* Removed the method positional_by_default() and associated class property 
	as this property wasn't used anywhere, so to simplify things.  This change 
	would break any code that depends on the method to be there.
	
	* Added convenience methods start_html() and end_html() which make a canned 
	html header and footer respectively.  They are much simpler than the ones 
	removed for the previous release, and not proprietary.

	* Release 1.02.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:
	
HTML::
::EasyTags        bdpO Make proper HTML 4 tags/lists/parts          DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "HTML::EasyTags" module, which was previously a 
	part of the following distributions under the temporary name of 
	"HTML::TagMaker": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	It also requires Class::ParamParser 1.01.

	* Code changes since HTML::TagMaker consist mainly in the removal of the 
	start_html() and end_html() methods; these were superfluous to the purpose 
	of the module, had unstable feature sets, and I deemed them proprietary.
	The POD also received significant updates.

	* CGI-FormGenerator 0.9201, the last version of any distribution to include

HTML::TagMaker, was released on CPAN.

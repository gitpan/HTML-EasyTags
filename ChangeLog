	* Release 1.02.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:
	
HTML::
::EasyTags        bdpO Make proper HTML 4 tags/lists/parts          DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "HTML::EasyTags" module, which was previously a 
	part of the following distributions under the temporary name of 
	"HTML::TagMaker": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004 (although 5.0 may work).
	It also requires Class::ParamParser 1.01.

	* Code changes since HTML::TagMaker consist mainly in the removal of the 
	start_html() and end_html() methods; these were superfluous to the purpose 
	of the module, had unstable feature sets, and I deemed them proprietary.
	The POD also received significant updates.

PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "HTML::EasyTags", 
for making well-formed XHTML or HTML 4 tags/lists/parts easily.

All of my modules have complete POD inside of them, so please refer to that for a
description of the module itself.

This Read Me document concerns itself mainly with installation and support
issues, and also includes any "To Do" lists.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

REQUIREMENTS

All of my modules require Perl 5.004 or newer, even though only some of them need
it, in the interest of consistency.  That said, Perl 5.004 is already 3 years 
old, is available as a binary on practically every OS that supports Perl at all, 
and is a very solid release, so I see no reason to support anything older.

This module doesn't require anything else.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains all of the extracted 
distribution files, including this ReadMe file, and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The last step probably won't work if you are not the administrator of your 
machine; in that case you either need to get your administrator to install this 
for you, or put it in a your own local directory instead.

The Makefile.PL can do this for you if you substitute something like the 
following for the first line above:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/myperl5
	
or:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/myperl5

If you are on a Mac system that is older than Mac OS X (Mac OS 9 or earlier)
and/or you are otherwise having problems with the Makefile, you can still
install this module the old fashioned way, by copying.

The file "EasyTags.pm" goes inside the "HTML" folder which is in the "lib" 
folder that came with your Perl 5 distribution.  

Or alternately, put it anywhere you want, but you will need to have that 
location added to your include path by your main program using something like 
this:

	use lib '/users/me/www_files/lib';

Then you would want to run the included test program to make sure the module is 
installed correctly.  Call it with:

	perl -w test.pl

Any existing POD is embedded in the module itself.  The Makefile probably 
extracted it for you in the usual manner, or you can run a POD extractor on it 
yourself to the same effect.  You can also find an HTMLized copy of the POD on 
CPAN and other public source archives; I link to one copy of it on my web site.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

TO DO

	* Perhaps force output to be well-formed XHTML/XML by throwing exceptions 
	when provided tag names or tag attribute names are numbers or contain bad 
	characters like whitespace.
	* Allow the option of html escaping 'text' values, which sometimes contain 
	html characters that we want to stay html.
	* Allow customization of the now-constant class properties that determine 
	the default format for new tags, such as which are "no pair tags" (that is, 
	in minimized format) and which are "no value attributes" (with false values, 
	names don't appear either), and preferred order of attributes in tags.
	* I have no more ideas in this regard, but am open to suggestions.
	* Get my other modules done.
